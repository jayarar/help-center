### I have a question about the store / products / my order, who do I ask?

All inquiries can be submitted at the "Submit a Request" link above, or via e-mail at help@famehouse.net


We do our best to get back to everyone as fast as possible. Normally, we will respond within 2 business days.


Please note that sending multiple emails or requests will slow the response time. Additionally, please note that we do not have a phone number or call support at this time. We are happy to assist you via email!


### I don’t want the items that I ordered anymore. How can I return them for a refund or an exchange?

Please reach out to us for instructions on how and where to return/exchange your item. Please provide us with your order number and the name of the item that you wish to return.

Please see below for our policies regarding returns and exchanges:

We only accept returns and exchanges within 45 days of the delivery date.
Items must not be worn, washed, or damaged. All items must be returned unwashed, unworn, unaltered, and in their original packaging, including all tags and accessories.
We do not accept returns or exchanges for clearance or sale items.
We do not accept exchanges for limited edition merchandise.
The customer is responsible for the cost of a return or exchange shipment unless the return or exchange is necessary due to fault of the company (see “Damaged, Incorrect, or Incomplete Orders”)
If you are returning an item for a refund, please allow 3-5 days for your item to be processed at our facilities once it has been delivered. Once processed, you will be notified via email. Refunds can take anywhere from 3-10 business days to appear in your bank account once they have been processed.

We encourage anyone returning a package to receive tracking information from their carrier once they ship it back to us to guarantee arrival.

### I purchased merchandise at a show or at a concert, can I make a return or exchange?

We cannot accommodate any return or exchange requests for merchandise purchased at a concert or show. We can only assist customers who purchased an item online through a store that we are associated with.

### Do you have a sizing chart for this item?

Please note that we do not have size charts for items unless otherwise specified on the store.
